    <h3>Steak Overview</h3>
    <p>Cooking the perfect steak is easy when you follow these simple steps. Start by choosing a good cut of steak, such as ribeye, filet mignon, or New York strip. Season the steak with salt, pepper, and any additional spices you like. Heat a cast-iron skillet or grill, then cook the steak to your desired level of doneness, whether it's rare, medium, or well-done.</p>
    <p>For a richer flavor, you can add butter and garlic in the final minutes of cooking. Let the steak rest after cooking to allow the juices to redistribute. Slice and serve with your favorite sides for a delicious meal.</p>
