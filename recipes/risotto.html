    <h3>Parmesan Risotto Overview</h3>
    <p>Making a creamy Parmesan risotto is all about patience and the right technique. Start by sautéing onions in butter and olive oil until soft, then add Arborio rice and cook until it's lightly toasted. Gradually add warm stock, stirring constantly to allow the rice to absorb the liquid. As the risotto cooks, it becomes creamy and tender, absorbing the flavors from the stock.</p>
    <p>Once the rice is cooked to a creamy consistency, stir in freshly grated Parmesan cheese and season with salt and pepper to taste. The result is a rich, velvety risotto that pairs perfectly with any main dish or can be enjoyed on its own.</p>
